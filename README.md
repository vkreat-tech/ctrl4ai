## Highlights
- Open Source Package with emphasis on data preprocessing so far.
- Self intelligent methods that can be employed at the levels of abstraction or customization.
- The flow of auto-preprocessing is orchestrated compatible to the learning type.
- Parameter tuning allows users to transform the data precisely to their specifications.
- Developed computations for inspecting the data to discover its type, distribution, correlation etc. which are handled in the background.
