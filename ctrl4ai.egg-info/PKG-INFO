        ## Highlights
        - Open Source Package with emphasis on data preprocessing so far.
        - Self intelligent methods that can be employed at the levels of abstraction or customization.
        - The flow of auto-preprocessing is orchestrated compatible to the learning type.
        - Parameter tuning allows users to transform the data precisely to their specifications.
        - Developed computations for inspecting the data to discover its type, distribution, correlation etc. which are handled in the background.
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        Ctrl4AI requires:
        
        * Python 3 (tested under Python 3.6)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to install the latest release version of Ctrl4AI is via ```pip```:
        ```bash
        pip install ctrl4ai
        ```
        In case you get ```ERROR: Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError```, try using
        ```bash
        pip install ctrl4ai --user
        ```
        Check for the latest available version in [Ctrl4AI](https://pypi.org/project/ctrl4ai/)
        
        ## Import
        
        Import any module from the package thru the following method:
        ```bash
        from ctrl4ai import prepdata
        ```
        ```bash
        from ctrl4ai import automl
        ```
        
        ## Learn to use
        
        Understand what each functions does by using ```help()```:
        ```bash
        help(automl.preprocess)
        ```
        
        ## ChangeLog
        
        - Added features to transform ordinal values (from string to integers)
        
        ## Depreciation Notice
        
        - All functions in ```ctrl4ai.preprocessing``` will be depreciated by the end of 2021. Please plan to switch to the same functions in ```ctrl4ai.prepdata```
        
        ## ToDo
        
        - Model specific pre-processing
        - Prepare dataset for bagging Algorithms
        - Preprocessing for Text,Image,Audio,Video Analytics
